## MRI - Monitor for Remote Inspection
MRI is a debug monitor which allows the GNU debugger, GDB, to debug Cortex-M3/M4 processors. This makes it possible to debug applications running on Cortex-M devices using a full featured source level debugger with no extra hardware other than a serial connection.

**Important Notes:**
* MRI is meant to work with [arm-none-eabi-gdb](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain). See notes [here](https://github.com/adamgreen/mri/pull/32#issuecomment-1221658927) about running other OS ABI versions of GDB with ARM target support.
* This project just contains the sources to build the MRI debug monitor library but doesn't show how to link it into your program and make use of it.  Such an example is provided by the [GCC4MBED project.](https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed)


## MRI Features
* 6+ hardware breakpoints (actual number depends on device)
* 4+ data watchpoints (actual number depends on device)
* single stepping
* runs over any of the UART ports on the device (selected when user compiles their code)
* baud rate is determined at runtime (through GDB command line) on devices that support auto-baud detection
* semi-host functionality:
  * stdout/stderr/stdin are redirected to/from the GDB console
  * mbed LocalFileSystem semi-host support (fopen, fwrite, fread, fseek, and fclose) - **mbed-LPC1768 only**
  * maintains access to mbed device's unique ethernet address - **mbed-LPC1768 only**
* works with free [GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)
* no program binary size limitations
* open source (Apache Licensed)

## How to Clone
This project uses submodules (CppUTest for unit testing).  Cloning requires a few more steps to get all of the necessary
code.

```
git clone git@github.com:adamgreen/mri.git
cd mri
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

**- or -**

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:adamgreen/mri.git
```

Notice: 
To let the Carvera work perfectly, please make sure both your controller software and firmware are up to date. For firmware, download the new firmware first, then use the 'update' function to upgrade the firmware, and reset the machine after the update is complete.
[1.0.3c1.0.6]
- properly update to makera 1.0.3, something went wrong in 1.0.5 where not all the code came over
[1.0.3c1.0.5]
- added support for touch probe on carvera air
- refactor of probing sequences code to combine repeated code
- added S2 parameter for M462, M464, M466 that also saves Z offset if an H parameter is given
- M466 added 3 axis simultanious move support for part inspections
- TLO probe calibration modification to increase accuracy
- Tools 999990-999999 are for 3 axis probes. Tools outside this range cannot be used for M46X commands
- added config setting config-set sd zprobe.tool_zero_is_3axis true allows the user to choose if tool 0 is also considered a 3 axis probe
- added config setting config-set sd zprobe.calibration_safety_margin 0.1, during calibration of probe TLO, max distance to move after calibrate pin but before probe pin detected
